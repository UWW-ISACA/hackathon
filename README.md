# Hackathon Website

To maintain this website, there's a couple things that you will need to install to either your local machine or a specific development virtual environment.

# Requirements

### Install [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
For a quick rundown on what the Rails framework is, please watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYm0kfnRTJk). \
We will be utilizing [Ruby Gems](https://medium.com/@morgannegagne/what-is-a-ruby-gem-1eec2684e68) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to maintain the website.

### Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
Git is a version control technology that allows us to track changes in code over time (along with who changed what).

### Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
VSCode is a lightweight text editor that can easily be transformed into a development environment.
