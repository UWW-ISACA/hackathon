# Hackathon Website

To maintain this website, there's a couple things that you will need to install to either your local machine or your virtual development environment. You will also need to be a member of the UWW ISACA organization and have the necessary permissions to make changes in the repository. 

# Requirements

### Install [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
For a quick rundown on what the Rails framework is, please watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYm0kfnRTJk). \
We will be utilizing [Ruby Gems](https://medium.com/@morgannegagne/what-is-a-ruby-gem-1eec2684e68) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to maintain the website.

### Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
Git is a version control technology that allows us to track changes in code over time (along with who changed what).\
For more information, watch [this video](https://github.com/UWW-ISACA/hackathon.git)

### Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
VSCode is a lightweight text editor that can easily be transformed into an integrated development environment. 
Very similar to Microsoft Word, but much more versatile for coding and development.

# Getting Started

Once you have setup your developer environment, you should be able to successfully run this command in your terminal: \
``` git clone https://github.com/UWW-ISACA/hackathon.git ``` \
